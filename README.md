# Welcome!
We are Yap Yunqi and Leanne Chan, current students in the Penn MUSA programme and Python data viz enthusiasts! 

For our final MUSA620 project, we decided to analyze gentrification trends in New York City. We have spent the past 13 weeks learning different data wrangling and visualization techniques in Python: such as plotting interactive graphs and maps using Altair, Holoviews and Seaborn; working with large datasets using Dask; scraping websites; using OSM networks; and much much more! These have culminated in a final project, presented here. 

Many thanks to Nick Hand, Professor of MUSA620!
