We used OSM data to analyze the locations of dining (cafes and restaurants) and nightlife (nightclubs and bars) amenities in New York City.

## Heatmap of Dining and Nightlife Amenities 

The following is a heatmap with 4 layers: neighborhoods, boroughs, dining amenities, and nightlife amenities. Users can toggle between the layers by pressing the button at the top right hand corner of the plot. It is clear that there are hardly any amenities on Staten Island, while amenities are concentrated all throughout Manhattan. Queens and Bronx have somewhat patchy clusters of amenities, while amenities are unevenly distributed across Brooklyn, with higher concentrations located closer to Manhattan.
